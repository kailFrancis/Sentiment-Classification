# Sentiment-Classification

*** ONGOING ***

Self guided NLP sentiment classification project over summer of 2023. Using a public dataset of airline reviews to train a deep LSTM network to classify the sentiment of a review into positive, neutral or negative.

The public dataset was first cleaned, processed and converted to word embeddings using spaCy's pretrained word embedding model. The code for this is in 'creating_vectorized_dataset.py'.
This data was then used to train a deep LSTM network to classify sentiments. The code for this is in 'main.ipynb'.

This project is ongoing; I intend on experimenting with different hyperparameter values, different deep learning models and NLP techniques.
